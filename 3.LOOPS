---FOR LOOPS---
write a program that asks for a number from the user and prints hello world from the number given by the user.
#include <stdio.h>
int main (void){
  int x;
  printf("Enter a number:");
  scanf("%d",&x);
  
  for(i = 0;i < x;i++){
  printf("hello world\n")
  }
}
---ADVANCED FOR LOOP---

#include <stdio.h>
int main (void){
  //for i to be accessible you have to declare it outside the for loop(int i;)
  for(i = 0;i < x;i++){
  printf("hello\n");
}//2.because after the scope is closed the declared variables will be deleted or terminated
  printf("%d\n",i);//1.this will return an error:i undefined
  }
  //however its good practice to declare variable in the smallest scope possible 
---NESTED FOR LOOP---
**loop in loop literally the first part with a loop inside of a loop**
